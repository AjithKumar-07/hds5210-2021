20.3 - Works great. Consider using variable names that are more descriptive, though.  `array` and `lists1` don't help the reader understand what you're doing.

20.4 - Instead of making `result = []` and then appending the name and conclusion, you could just say `result = [name, 'too short']` inside your if/then blocks.  That would be a bit more concise to read.

All good work, just some things to consider.
