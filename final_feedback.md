Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

I appreciate your thoughtful notes through the initial data profiling activities.  You noticed how much missing data you had and took the time to consider what that might mean to your analysis.  Choosing to remove some columns from analysis was a good direction.  Consider if there's an option to impute missing data, too.

Seaborn's pairplot was a great choice as part of your data exploration.  Nicely done.  Your choice on the countplot was less helpful, though.  More appropriate would have been a traditional histogram or KDE.

With your correlation plots, while a good analysis to do, I think you made some conclusions that aren't substantiated by the evidence.  Some of them would not hold up to critical statistical analysis (not part of this course).

Nicely done overall.  Great work this semester!
